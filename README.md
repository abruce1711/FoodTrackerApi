# Food Tracker Lambda Function
A Lambda Function to serve as the backend of an application in which users can track the expiry dates of food items.

The project was created largely for me to test out things I learned while studying for my AWS Developer Exam.
I have used an API Gateway to call this Lambda function, which hooks into a Dynamo DB.
